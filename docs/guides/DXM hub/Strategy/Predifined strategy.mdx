## Business Rules

###

Business Rules are manually configured filtering conditions applied on top of the strategy to target a specific subset of products. Only those products that match the filtering conditions are displayed on the module. You can configure multiple business rules as long as every condition is met and yields results to serve the product recommendations. Business Rules can be set while configuring models and while creating an experience.

| **Field**  | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Filter     | Choose the product attribute from the drop-down to set the filtering condition. For example, the brand filter lets you limit the range of products included in the recommendation to a particular brand.                                                                                                                                                         |
| Condition  | Choose the filtering condition for the corresponding filter from the drop-down. For example, you can choose one of the following conditions for brand filters: Is, Is not, When applied. These conditions limit the recommendation result to a specific set of products that match the criteria. Note: The conditions will vary depending on the type of filter. |
| Value      | Choose a value for the corresponding filter. For example, you can enter a numeric value for a price filter or select a brand name for the brand filter.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Value Type | The currency type of the filter. If you choose % of source, then only products priced in that price percentage range will be considered. For example, if the source product price is $100 and the filtering rule is set as: Price equals 20 % of the source, then only product priced $20 will                                                                   |

**For example:**

For Business use case - To display only dresses priced less than or equal to $100 in "Most Popular Dresses"

Set Filtering Condition:

Filter: Price

Condition: less than or equal to

Value: 100

Value Type: $

**Apply To:**

Attribute: Category

Condition: Is

Value: Dresses

**_WARNING:_**

Ensure business rules do not conflict with each other.

Ensure your inventory will support a business rule before you add one.

## Personalization :

Personalization can be applied on top of any strategy as a rule to sort the content based on the user's activity.
